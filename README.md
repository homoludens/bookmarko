Flaskmarks
===============
Simple (and self educational) [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) & [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) based bookmark and RSS feed app.

Features
========
"Flaskmarks" is a bookmark managing application. Its purpose is to be a all-in-one bookmark and RSS feed repository. Storing all bookmarks and RSS feeds in one place and make them accessible from all platforms and devices. This is by no means an original idea, but this is an interpretation of the problem.

I have added couple of features I have missed in every bookmarking app: Full Text search of bookmarked links and local copy parsed with python-readability.
This can be used as "Read latter" app.

- Bookmarking
- Full text search
- Readability



Setting up virual envirement
============================

* `$ sudo pip install virtualenv`
* `$ virtualenv venv`
* `$ . venv/bin/activate`

Install
=======
* Create and activate a python virtualenv.
* make a copy of config.py.example to config.py and edit accordingly.
* run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* run: `flask --app flaskmarks db init`
* run: `flask --app flaskmarks db migrate -m "MIGRATION DESCRIPTION"`
* run: `flask --app flaskmarks db upgrade`
* run: `flask --app flaskmarks db`
* or gunicorn `gunicorn -w 4 'flaskmarks:app'`

>>> python3
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
>>> nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
>>> nltk.download('wordnet')


Exit virtualenv
==============

$ deactivate

Ubuntu
======
Installing this app on a Ubuntu server may take a little more effort than `pip install -r requirements.txt`. On some systems the following packages need to be installed:
* run: `sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python2.7-dev build-essential`

Upgrade
=======
* run: `python run.py db migrate`
* run: `python run.py db upgrade`

Package updates
===============
* run: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

Simple deployment with nginx
============================
* edit and install examples/flaskmarks.nginx.example
* run: `python run.py runserver -p 5001`

Branches
========
There will at any given point be at least two branches in this repository. One
master (stable) branch, and one develop branch. The develop branch might contain
unfinished code and/or wonky solutions. I will strive to make sure that code 
merged into master is as stable as possible (given the small size of this application).

Using
====

Import of firefox bookmark from exported json kinda works. Go to "Show all bookmarks" and than to "Backup".


Keyword extraction options
==========================

I have tried this options for keyword extraction. Newspaper3k is the current one.

* https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper - Newspaper3k: Article scraping & curation
* https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ - Analyze plain-text documents for semantic structure
* https://github.com/csurfer/rake-nltk - Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction algorithm


TODO
====

* try out http://getskeleton.com css instead of bootstrap, looks much simpler.



Database
========

PostgreSQL:

CREATE DATABASE bookmarko;
CREATE USER bookm_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'digestpass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE bookmarko TO bookm_user;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO bookm_user;
ALTER DATABASE bookmarko OWNER TO bookm_user;

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://bookm_user:digestpass@localhost:5432/bookmarko"


## Add full text search for postgresdb 

-- Run this SQL migration
ALTER TABLE marks 
ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector 
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title, '')), 'A') ||
    setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(full_html, '')), 'B')
) STORED;

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_marks_search ON marks USING gin(search_vector);
